            My place was really professionally clean and I recommend this service to all my friends. One of my friends recommended this service as I was moving out and I wanted to make sure I got my deposit back. I contacted Kiwi-Cleaning through their E-mail and received a reply within an hour. On the phone, I talked about which service I wanted ( End of Tenancy clean) and from there we set up the date and a time window. The workers arrived on time and were respectful. Overall the Job took the workers less than 2 hours and my apartment was clean when I got back home.

          Really happy with their service. The workers were kind and they finished the job on time. Heard about Kiwi Cleaning through a colleague who used them before for his rental agreement. Contacted them through the phone and got a response within an hour. Booked a date and time for them to come clean. The workers arrived on time and started to work straight away. After 3 hours my house was clean and I was really happy with their service.
